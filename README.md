## Overview
This repository contains the code, analysis, and findings from our research study examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student behaviors and well-being. Using data from 1,182 student responses, we investigated the complex interrelationships between time allocation patterns, digital behaviors, and health outcomes during lockdown periods.

## Key Research Areas
- Time allocation patterns across activities (online classes, self-study, sleep, fitness, social media)
- Impact of different online learning platforms on student experiences
- Relationship between digital behaviors and health outcomes
- Regional and demographic variations in student responses to remote learning

## Methodology
The study employed multiple statistical approaches to analyze the survey data:
- Chi-square tests for associations between categorical variables
- ANOVA for comparing means across groups
- Logistic regression for predicting health outcomes
- Correlation analysis for relationships between time allocation variables
- Ordinal regression for analyzing online learning experience factors

## Key Findings

### Health and Time Allocation
- Physical activity emerged as a critical protective factor for student health
- Students without health issues spent significantly more time on fitness activities
- Sleep duration and fitness time were negatively associated with reported health issues

### Weight Change Dynamics
- Statistically significant association between weight change and health status
- Students reporting decreased weight spent more time on fitness activities
- Social media usage was highest among students with increased weight

### Online Learning Experience
- Medium used for online classes significantly affected satisfaction levels
- Tablet users reported higher engagement levels than smartphone or laptop users
- Self-study time and sleep duration were positive predictors of learning satisfaction
- Optimal satisfaction occurred with moderate time allocation (4-6 hours)

### Digital Media Usage
- Strong platform preference concentration (Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube)
- Significant negative correlation between self-study and social media time
- Minimal regional differences in social media usage patterns
